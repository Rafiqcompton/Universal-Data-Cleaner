The algorithm needs to be trained on a dataset of clean and dirty data in order to learn how to identify and correct different types of errors.
The algorithm can handle different data types, including strings, floats, and integers. However, it may not be able to handle more complex data types such as images or videos.
The algorithm can be used to clean multiple columns in a dataset at the same time. However, it is important to note that the cleaning rules for each column may be different.
